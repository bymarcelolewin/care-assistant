Customer: "Yes"
System: [Shows claims]
```
*Result: 3 interactions*

Customer: "What plan do I have and do I have pending claims?"
System: [Provides both plan info AND claims in one response]
```
*Result: 1 interaction* ‚ú®

### 2. **Natural Language Understanding**

Customers can express themselves naturally:

All understood correctly!

System: "Your PPO Gold plan includes..." [remembers which plan]
```
