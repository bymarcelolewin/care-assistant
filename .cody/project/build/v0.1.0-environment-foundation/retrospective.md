# Version Retrospective â€“ v0.1.0 - Environment & Foundation

This document reflects on what worked, what didn't, and how future versions can be improved.

## Version Summary

**Version:** 0.1.0 - Environment & Foundation
**Status:** âœ… Completed
**Duration:** Single session
**Total Tasks:** 33 tasks across 6 phases
**Completion Rate:** 100%

**Deliverables:**
- Virtual environment with uv package manager
- All required dependencies installed (LangGraph, LangChain, FastAPI, etc.)
- Complete project structure (app/, tests/, .cody/)
- Mock data (3 users, 3 insurance plans, 9 claims)
- FastAPI server with health check
- Ollama integration verified
- Comprehensive documentation (README, data schemas, code comments)
- .gitignore and project hygiene files

## What Went Well

### 1. **Clear Planning Phase**
The discovery, PRD, and implementation plan documents provided excellent guidance throughout development. Having design decisions documented (model choice, data structure, etc.) prevented decision paralysis.

### 2. **Structured Task Breakdown**
Breaking the version into 6 phases with 33 specific tasks made progress trackable and prevented overwhelm. Each phase had clear entry/exit criteria.

### 3. **Mock Data Design**
Creating realistic but simple mock data struck the right balance for a POC. Three users with diverse scenarios (different plans, deductible statuses) provide enough variety without complexity.

### 4. **Documentation-First Approach**
Writing comprehensive documentation (README, data schemas) during development rather than after meant documentation stayed accurate and complete.

### 5. **uv Package Manager**
Using `uv` instead of traditional `pip` was fast and efficient. Virtual environment creation and package installation were noticeably quicker.

### 6. **Ollama Local LLM**
Running llama3.3:70b locally worked perfectly. No API keys, no rate limits, and good response quality for insurance questions.

### 7. **Type Checking Setup**
Enabling Python type checking (basic mode) early caught potential issues without being overly strict. Good balance for learning/POC work.

### 8. **Test Files Organization**
Moving test files to `tests/` folder kept the project organized from the start. Good foundation for adding more tests later.

## What Could Have Gone Better

### 1. **LangChain Deprecation Warning**
Using `langchain-community.llms.Ollama` triggered deprecation warnings. Should have used `langchain-ollama` from the start.

**Impact:** Minor - still works fine, but will need updating later.

### 2. **Initial Confusion with .venv vs venv**
Small naming confusion (`.venv` vs `venv`) caused a brief delay during testing.

**Impact:** Minimal - quickly resolved, but highlights importance of being explicit about hidden files.

### 3. **Path Understanding for Bash Tool**
The Bash tool doesn't automatically use the virtual environment's Python, requiring explicit `.venv/bin/python` calls.

**Impact:** Minor learning curve but not a blocker.

### 4. **No Automated Testing Yet**
While we created `test_ollama.py`, there's no automated test runner (pytest) or CI/CD setup yet.

**Impact:** Testing is manual for now. Will need to address in future versions.

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

1. **Virtual Environment Paths:** Always use `.venv/bin/python` explicitly when running scripts programmatically. Don't assume environment activation carries through.

2. **Documentation Timing:** Writing docs during development (not after) keeps them accurate and forces clarity of thought.

3. **Mock Data First:** Creating realistic mock data early makes testing and development much easier than waiting until you need it.

4. **Type Hints + Basic Type Checking:** Using type hints throughout with basic type checking catches errors early without slowing development.

### Process Lessons

1. **Cody Framework Value:** The structured approach (discovery â†’ PRD â†’ plan â†’ tasklist â†’ implementation) prevented scope creep and kept focus clear.

2. **Small, Trackable Tasks:** 33 small tasks felt more manageable than 8 large features. Breaking things down is worth the upfront effort.

3. **Decision Documentation:** Recording decisions (like model choice, data structure) in the design doc prevented revisiting the same questions.

4. **End-to-End Verification:** Running comprehensive verification at the end caught issues early before moving to next version.

### Learning Focus Lessons

1. **Comments Matter:** Since this is a learning project, extensive comments throughout code are essential. Don't assume future you (or future learners) will understand the why.

2. **README Completeness:** Troubleshooting section in README anticipated common issues. Very helpful for future use.

3. **Progressive Complexity:** Starting with foundation (env, data, server) before LangGraph complexity was the right call. Build on solid ground.

## Action Items

### For Version 0.2.0 (Core Agent)

1. **Update to langchain-ollama:** Replace `langchain-community.llms.Ollama` with newer `langchain_ollama.OllamaLLM` to avoid deprecation warnings.

2. **Add Pytest Setup:** Install pytest and create test configuration for automated testing of tools and nodes.

3. **State Schema Design:** Spend extra time on state schema design since it's the foundation for all LangGraph work.

4. **Tool Testing Strategy:** Each tool should have a test case before integrating with the graph.

5. **Execution Trace Early:** Build execution trace capture from the start, not as an afterthought.

### For Future Versions

1. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Consider adding GitHub Actions for automated testing when ready.

2. **Linting Setup:** Add ruff or black for consistent code formatting.

3. **Type Checking:** Keep using type hints and basic type checking mode.

4. **Documentation Updates:** Update main README as each version completes to keep it current.

### Process Improvements

1. **Git Commits:** Commit after each phase completion, not just at version end.

2. **Branch Strategy:** Consider using feature branches for larger versions.

3. **Version Tags:** Tag git commits with version numbers for easy reference.

## Overall Assessment

**Success Rating:** ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ (5/5)

Version 0.1.0 was a complete success. All planned features were delivered, documentation is comprehensive, and the foundation is solid for building the LangGraph agent in v0.2.0. The structured Cody Framework approach kept development focused and prevented common pitfalls like scope creep or premature optimization.

**Ready for Next Version:** âœ… Yes

The environment is stable, dependencies are working, mock data is realistic, and Ollama integration is verified. Version 0.2.0 (Core Agent) can begin immediately.

## Notes

- **Technology Choices:** Python 3.13.3, uv for packages, llama3.3:70b for LLM all worked excellently.
- **Development Style:** Learning-focused with extensive comments proved valuable even during initial development.
- **Project Organization:** Clean structure from day one makes everything easier.
