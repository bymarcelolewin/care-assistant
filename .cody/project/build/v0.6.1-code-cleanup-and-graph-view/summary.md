# Version 0.6.1 - Code Cleanup and Graph View

**Build Date:** October 16, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

---

## Overview

This release adds a graph visualization page to the CARE Assistant web interface and removes legacy unused code, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

---

## What We Built

### 1. Graph Visualization Feature

Added a new page to visualize the LangGraph conversation flow structure directly in the web interface.

#### Backend Changes

**New File:** `app/api/graph.py`
- Created REST API endpoint `GET /api/graph`
- Returns PNG image of the LangGraph structure using Mermaid diagrams
- Includes caching headers for performance (1-hour cache)

**Modified:** `app/main.py`
- Registered the new graph router
- Updated catch-all route to properly serve Next.js static export HTML files
- Fixed routing to serve `graph.html` instead of always serving `index.html`

#### Frontend Changes

**New File:** `frontend/app/graph/page.tsx`
- Created graph visualization page at `/graph` route
- Features:
  - Displays the LangGraph structure as a PNG image
  - "Back to Chat" button for easy navigation
  - "Refresh" button to reload the graph
  - Loading and error states
  - Educational description of each node's purpose
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

**Modified:** `frontend/components/chat/ChatHeader.tsx`
- Added "View Graph" button with GitBranch icon
- Button navigates to `/graph` page
- Positioned next to "Clear Conversation" button

#### How It Works

```
User clicks "View Graph"
  ‚Üí Frontend loads /graph page
  ‚Üí Page fetches PNG from /api/graph
  ‚Üí Backend compiles LangGraph agent
  ‚Üí Backend generates Mermaid diagram
  ‚Üí Backend returns PNG bytes
  ‚Üí Frontend displays image
```

### 2. Code Cleanup - Removed Legacy Nodes

Cleaned up the codebase by removing unused legacy node implementations.

**Modified:** `app/graph/nodes.py`

**Removed:**
- `coverage_lookup_node` (Node 3) - 42 lines
- `benefit_verify_node` (Node 4) - 73 lines
- `claims_status_node` (Node 5) - 48 lines
- Total: **163 lines removed**

**Why These Were Removed:**

These nodes were from an older architecture that used separate nodes for each tool. They have been replaced by the more sophisticated `orchestrate_tools` node which:
- Handles multiple tools in a single node
- Uses LLM to intelligently determine which tools to call
- Supports complex multi-intent questions
- Eliminates the need for manual intent classification

**Old Architecture (Removed):**
```
identify_user ‚Üí [intent classifier] ‚Üí coverage_lookup_node
                                    ‚Üí benefit_verify_node
                                    ‚Üí claims_status_node
                                    ‚Üí generate_response
```

**Current Architecture:**
```
identify_user ‚Üí orchestrate_tools ‚Üí generate_response
```

## Files Modified

### Backend
- ‚úÖ `app/api/graph.py` (new)
- ‚úÖ `app/main.py` (modified - added graph router, fixed static file routing)
- ‚úÖ `app/graph/nodes.py` (modified - removed 3 legacy nodes)

### Frontend
- ‚úÖ `frontend/app/graph/page.tsx` (new)
- ‚úÖ `frontend/components/chat/ChatHeader.tsx` (modified - added navigation button)

---

## Graph Structure Visualization

The graph now displays these **3 active nodes**:

### Node 1: identify_user
- Identifies users by name
- Loads user profile from data
- Handles conversational name extraction using LLM

### Node 2: orchestrate_tools
- Intelligently determines which tools to call
- Can execute multiple tools in one turn
- Supports: coverage_lookup, benefit_verify, claims_status
- Replaces manual intent classification

### Node 3: generate_response
- Synthesizes tool results into natural language
- Uses full conversation context
- Provides helpful, conversational responses

---

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoint
```python
@router.get("/api/graph")
async def get_graph_visualization():
    agent = compile_agent()
    png_bytes = agent.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()
    return Response(content=png_bytes, media_type="image/png")
```

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
const url = `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || "http://localhost:8000"}/api/graph`
const response = await fetch(url)
// Display image in <img> tag
```

### Static File Routing Fix
```python
# Check for specific HTML files from Next.js export
if full_path and not full_path.startswith("_next"):
    html_file = FRONTEND_BUILD_DIR / f"{full_path}.html"
    if html_file.exists():
        return FileResponse(html_file)
```

---

## How to Use

### Build and Run

1. **Build the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   uv run uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Main app: http://localhost:8000
   - Graph page: http://localhost:8000/graph

### Navigation

- Click "View Graph" button in chat header
- Or navigate directly to `/graph` route
- Click "Back to Chat" to return to main interface

---

## Benefits

### For Developers
- üìä **Visual understanding** of conversation flow
- üîç **Better debugging** - see exactly how the graph is structured
- üìö **Learning tool** - understand LangGraph architecture
- üßπ **Cleaner codebase** - removed 163 lines of unused code

### For Users
- üé® **Transparency** - see how the AI processes requests
- üó∫Ô∏è **Educational** - understand the system architecture
- üöÄ **Easy access** - one click from main interface

---

## Code Quality Improvements

### Before
- 6 node functions defined (3 unused)
- 803 lines in nodes.py
- Confusing legacy code with "LEGACY" comments
- Graph visualization only via Python scripts

### After
- 3 node functions (all active)
- 640 lines in nodes.py (-163 lines, -20%)
- Clean, focused codebase
- Graph visualization built into web interface

---

## Testing Performed

‚úÖ Backend API endpoint returns valid PNG image
‚úÖ Frontend page loads and displays graph
‚úÖ Navigation buttons work correctly
‚úÖ Static file routing serves correct HTML files
‚úÖ Error handling for loading states
‚úÖ Graph accurately reflects current architecture
‚úÖ All existing functionality still works

---

## Dependencies

No new dependencies added. Uses existing packages:
- LangGraph (for graph visualization via `get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()`)
- FastAPI (for API endpoint)
- Next.js (for frontend page)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Interactive graph with clickable nodes
- Real-time graph updates during conversation
- Node execution highlighting
- Export graph as SVG or PDF
- Zoom and pan functionality
- Dark mode support for graph visualization

---

## Migration Notes

### No Breaking Changes
- All existing API endpoints unchanged
- Frontend chat interface unchanged
- No database migrations needed
- No configuration changes required

### For Developers
If you were using the legacy nodes (`coverage_lookup_node`, `benefit_verify_node`, `claims_status_node`) in any custom code, they have been removed. Use the `orchestrate_tools` node instead.

---

## Conclusion

Version 0.6.1 successfully adds graph visualization to the web interface while cleaning up technical debt. The codebase is now more maintainable, and users have better visibility into how the conversation flow works.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue using the single command: `uv run uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000`
- Access graph at any time via the "View Graph" button
- Enjoy a cleaner, more focused codebase
