# Version Retrospective â€“ v0.6.0-move-data-folder-to-root
This document reflects on what worked, what didn't, and how future versions can be improved.

## Version Summary
Version 0.6.0 successfully reorganized the project structure by moving JSON data files from `/app/data/` to a new root-level `/data/` folder. This refactoring improved maintainability by providing clearer separation between data files and data-handling code. All 21 tasks across 6 phases were completed smoothly with comprehensive testing and documentation updates.

## What Went Well
_List things that were successful or effective during this version._

1. **Thorough Planning Phase**
   - Phase 1 (Preparation and Analysis) identified the exact scope early
   - Searching for hardcoded paths revealed we only needed to change one line in `loader.py`
   - This made the implementation much simpler than expected

2. **Clean Path Resolution**
   - The `Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent / "data"` approach works perfectly
   - Clear comments in code explain the navigation logic
   - No magic numbers or hardcoded paths

3. **Systematic Testing**
   - Data loading test passed immediately after code changes
   - All helper functions (get_user_by_id, get_plan_by_id, etc.) work correctly
   - No file not found errors detected

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - README.md updated to show new structure clearly
   - No other docs needed updating (clean separation of concerns)
   - Project structure diagram accurately reflects new organization

5. **Low Risk Refactoring**
   - Only internal implementation changed
   - Public API of loader.py remained unchanged
   - No changes needed to tools, nodes, or frontend code

## What Could Have Gone Better
_List things that caused friction, confusion, or delays._

1. **Initial Task Assignment Clarity**
   - Brief confusion about P4-4 being assigned to AGENT vs USER
   - Should have been clearer from the start about who does what in testing phases

2. **Documentation Search Scope**
   - Searched through many historical docs that didn't need updating
   - Could have focused search more narrowly on active documentation

3. **No Significant Issues**
   - This was a very smooth version with minimal friction
   - The scope was well-defined and the changes were straightforward

## Lessons Learned
_Both human and AI can add insights here. Focus on what to repeat or avoid in the future._

1. **Preparation Phase is Worth It**
   - Taking time to search for hardcoded paths saved time later
   - Understanding the current implementation before changing it is critical

2. **Small Scope = High Success**
   - This version had a narrow, well-defined goal
   - Made it easy to complete quickly and correctly
   - Better than trying to do too much at once

3. **Path Resolution Best Practices**
   - Using `Path(__file__).parent` navigation is cleaner than hardcoded paths
   - Adding comments explaining the path navigation helps maintainability

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Testing data loading first, then web interface, then end-to-end is the right order
   - Each test builds on the previous one

5. **Documentation is Part of the Work**
   - Updating README immediately keeps documentation in sync
   - Clear project structure diagrams help new developers understand the codebase

## Action Items
_Concrete steps or process changes to carry forward into the next version._

1. **Continue Using Phase-Based Approach**
   - The 6-phase structure (Prep, Create, Update, Test, Document, Verify) worked well
   - Use this pattern for future refactoring tasks

2. **Always Search for Hardcoded References**
   - This should be standard for any file/folder move
   - Prevents surprises later in testing

3. **Update Documentation Proactively**
   - Don't wait until the end to update README and other docs
   - Do it as part of the work, not after

4. **Keep Refactoring Scopes Small**
   - One clear goal per version
   - Makes testing and verification much easier

5. **Add Comments When Changing Paths**
   - The comment explaining `Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent / "data"` is very helpful
   - Always explain non-obvious path navigation
